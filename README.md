 Using LSTMs, CNNs, GRUs with a larger dataset


In this colab, I have used different kinds of layers to see how they affect the model.


The splits are:

*   train	67,349
*   validation	872


and the column headings are:

*   sentence
*   label

Check out the dataset here :https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html

The datset consists of positive and negative movie reviews
